Soldier is tasked to help the Emperor's beloved daughter to escape as they search for the machinist (computer programmer) who can program the flying drones in order to defeat the undead.

Thus begins their true mission of saving the empire. 

Along the way, they will meet other travelers, some of whom would become part of their growing entourage. 

Notable among these are a military strategist, old generals of the empire, those from a rival kingdom, and even an unlikely friend from the ranks of the underworld. 

Will they be able to unite the empire? 

The choice is yours.
